sbsmsampler is a VST plugin based on libsbsms (on sourceforge) which decomposes a sond into simusoidal tracks which can be instantiated as oscillator, filters, granulator, digital waveguides, etc.  It currenly ony wors on VST2.4, 32-bit with vstgui 2.4, on mac.  See ./build/macosx to change vst directory locations.

NOTE:
When reading the output from sbsms, you must determine a stopping condition for yourself, as the library zero pads the output ad infinitum and never returns 0 samples.  The simplest method for doing so is found in test.cpp.

Requirements
============

  POSIX systems (e.g. Linux, OS X):
  ---------------------------------

  You need at least to have libtool installed to be able to build the
  library with "./configure && make".

Compiling
=========

  Call './configure && make' on the console to compile the library, all
  tools and demo applications, documentation and install them with
  'make install'. The latter has to be called as root.

  If you are compiling from CVS you have to call 'make -f Makefile.cvs'
  to generate all autotools build files before calling
  './configure && make'.

  You can use 'make distclean' and probably 'make -f Makefile.cvs clean'
  to clean up everything again. The latter will also delete all automatic
  generated autools build files.
